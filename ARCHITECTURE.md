## Module Breakdown
1. **Data Collection Module**  
   - Responsible for collecting data from various sensors.  
   - Interfaces with:  
     - Sensor APIs  
     - Data storage  

2. **Data Processing Module**  
   - Processes raw data collected from sensors.  
   - Uses algorithms for filtering and analyzing data.  

3. **User Interface Module**  
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and interacting with data.  
   - Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  

4. **Reporting Module**  
   - Generates reports based on processed data.  
   - Supports exporting to PDF and CSV formats.

## Data Flow
- Data is collected by the Data Collection Module and sent to the Data Processing Module for analysis.  
- Processed data is then made available to the User Interface Module for visualization and interaction.  
- Reports are generated by the Reporting Module based on user interactions and processed data.

## Integration Points
- **Sensor Interface API**: The Data Collection Module integrates with sensor APIs for data acquisition.
- **Database**: Both the Data Processing and Reporting Modules interact with a centralized database for data storage and retrieval.
- **Third-party APIs**: Integration with third-party services for additional analytics and data enrichment where applicable.
